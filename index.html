      <h2>Snake</h2>
      <pre>
        This is a snake game with a twist. Like classic snake, there is a
        green snake that you control with the arrow keys. Instead of apples,
        however, there is a mouse that scurries around the page. Your goal as
        the snake is to devour the mouse, generating a new one. Eat as many
        mice as possible without running into the walls or eating your own
        tail.  Watch out though!  For every few mice you consume, you defecate.
        Don't eat your own feces, or you'll die!
        
        Arrow keys will change the direction of the snake.
        The spacebar pauses the game.
        
        Good luck! (My personal best is 23, we'll call that 'expert' level)
