        This is a snake game with a twist.
        Like classic snake, there is a green
        snake that you control with the arrow
        keys. Instead of apples, however, there
        is a mouse that scurries around the
        page. Your goal as the snake is to
        devour the mouse, generating a new one.
        Eat as many mice as possible without
        running into the walls or eating your own
        tail.  Watch out though!  For every few
        mice you consume, you defecate. Don't
        eat your own feces, or you'll die!
        
        Arrow keys will change the direction
        of the snake. The spacebar pauses the game.
        
        Good luck!

        we'll call that 'expert' level)
