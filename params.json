{"name":"Snake","tagline":"Classic snake game with a twist.","body":"### Snake\r\nThis Snake game is your classic snake game, with a bit of a twist.  Instead of apples, the snake eats a mouse that moves around the grid.  For every mouse your snake consumes, another will appear.  Eating four mice results in your snake disposing of defecating.  Watch out though! Not only will your snake die if it runs off the edge or eats itself, but it will also die if it accidentally eats it's own feces.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
